# FCC Visualize Data with Map Data Across the Globe (using D3.js)

This is a project using D3.js to create a Map of Meteorites landed that
is displayed on a world map.

Requirements:

1. The user can see where all Meteorites have landed on a world map.

2. The user can tell the relative size of the meteorite just by
looking at the way it's represented on the map.

3. The user can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional
data.


Data used for this graph is provided by: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json
